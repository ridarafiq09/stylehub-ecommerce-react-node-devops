## Project Overview

The frontend of the application is built using **React.js**, following a component-based architecture that improves reusability, maintainability, and performance. React hooks are used to manage state and handle dynamic UI updates.

The backend is implemented using **Node.js and Express**, providing RESTful APIs that handle application logic and data exchange. The frontend communicates with the backend using HTTP requests and JSON responses.

The project structure is designed to support **automation and deployment workflows**, allowing the application to be built, tested, and deployed consistently across different environments.
